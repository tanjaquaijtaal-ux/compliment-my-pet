# 🐶 Compliment My Pet 🐈

> A feel‑good AI agent that is always happy to talk about your pet — and will happily boost your mood along the way.

---

## 🚀 What is this? 🐣

**Compliment My Pet** is an AI agent where people can:
- Upload a photo of their pet **or**
- Simply talk about their pet

And get an **enthusiastic, positive, judgment‑free conversation** in return.

Anyone with pets knows the feeling:  
nothing is more fun than talking about *your* animal — but not everyone around you is always as enthusiastic.

This agent always is. It can even send you an e-mail on why your pet is the best. 💌

---

## 💛 Why this exists 🐔

This project is a **mood booster in agent form**.

After just a few minutes of chatting about your pet:
- You feel lighter  
- You smile  
- Your mood improves  

There may not be a traditional enterprise business case —  
but making people feel better **is** a valid one.

---

## ✨ Key takeaway

AI doesn’t always have to be productive.

Sometimes, it just needs to make people smile.

---

## 🧠 How it works (high level)

- Users upload a pet photo *or* start a conversation
- The agent responds with:
  - Compliments
  - Curiosity
  - Genuine enthusiasm
- The focus is on **emotional engagement**, not task completion

---

## 🛠️ Built with

- Microsoft Copilot Studio
- AI agent logic & prompting
- A lot of patience troubleshooting the responsible AI triggers

## 🧪 Learnings & known limitations 🐴

### Responsible AI triggers
In some cases, uploading a photo may unexpectedly trigger **Responsible AI restrictions**.

At the moment, the exact cause is not always clear.

**Suggested workaround:**
- Try uploading the same photo again, or
- Use a different photo, or
- Continue the conversation without a photo (this works perfectly)

This was an important learning about how **image input and safety systems** can behave in real-world scenarios.
