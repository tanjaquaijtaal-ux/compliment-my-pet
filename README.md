# 🐶 Compliment My Pet

> A feel‑good AI agent that is always happy to talk about your pet — and will happily boost your mood along the way.

---

## 🚀 What is this?

**Compliment My Pet** is an AI agent where people can:
- Upload a photo of their pet **or**
- Simply talk about their pet

And get an **enthusiastic, positive, judgment‑free conversation** in return.

Anyone with pets knows the feeling:  
nothing is more fun than talking about *your* animal — but not everyone around you is always as enthusiastic.

This agent always is.

---

## 💛 Why this exists

This project is a **mood booster in agent form**.

After just a few minutes of chatting about your pet:
- You feel lighter  
- You smile  
- Your mood improves  

There may not be a traditional enterprise business case —  
but making people feel better **is** a valid one.

## 🧪 Learnings & known limitations

### Responsible AI triggers
In some cases, uploading a photo may unexpectedly trigger **Responsible AI restrictions**.

At the moment, the exact cause is not always clear.

**Suggested workaround:**
- Try uploading the same photo again, or
- Use a different photo, or
- Continue the conversation without a photo (this works perfectly)

This was an important learning about how **image input and safety systems** can behave in real-world scenarios.
